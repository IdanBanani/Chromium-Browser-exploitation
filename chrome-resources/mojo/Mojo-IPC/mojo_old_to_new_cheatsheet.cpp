The following type replacements should be done across the tree.

In mojom syntax:

- Any interface proxy (i.e. typename T where T is an interface)
  becomes pending_remote<T>
- Any interface request (i.e. typename T& where T is an interface)
  becomes pending_receiver<T>
- Any associated interface proxy (associated T where T is an interface)
  becomes pending_associated_remote<T>
- Any associated interface request (associated T& where T is an 
  interface) becomes pending_associated_receiver<T>

In C++ code:

- InterfacePtr<T> and TPtr become Remote<T> **
- InterfacePtrInfo<T> and TPtrInfo become PendingRemote<T>
- AssociatedInterfacePtr<T> and TAssociatedPtr become AssociatedRemote<T>
- AssociatedInterfacePtrInfo<T> and TAssociatedPtrInfo become
  PendingAssociatedRemote<T>
- Binding<T> becomes Receiver<T>
- BindingSet<T> becomes ReceiverSet<T>
- InterfaceRequest<T> and TRequest become PendingReceiver<T>
- AssociatedBinding<T> becomes AssociatedReceiver<T>
- AssociatedBindingSet<T> becomes AssociatedReceiverSet<T>
- AssociatedInterfaceRequest<T> becomes PendingAssociatedReceiver<T>

Service-related C++ changes:

- Uses of service_manager::BinderRegistry should switch to
  service_manager::BinderMap, which uses the new Mojo bindings types
- Uses of service_manager::Connector should call Connect() instead
  of BindInterface() as the former uses new Mojo bindings types

A few other notes:

- Old types will be supported in the tree for the foreseeable future
  because other external repositories still depend on them. Once all
  Android and Chrome OS repos can be ported to new types, these will
  be removed. Hopefully sooner than that, we can block new uses of
  old types via PRESUBMIT warnings.
- We support implicit conversion between equivalent old/new intermediate
  types (e.g. between InterfacePtrInfo<T> and PendingRemote<T>; or
  between InterfaceRequest<T> and PendingReceiver<T>) to ease the
  transition of existing code.

** Note that for struct fields and method parameters generated from mojom 
files, types which previously generated as InterfacePtr<T> now generate
as PendingRemote<T> instead of Remote<T>. This combines the type rename a
long-standing intention to switch these values to InterfacePtrInfo<T> for
more efficiency and flexibility in interface passing.
